//22. Find H-Index

//Given an integer array citations[], where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for the ith paper. The task is to find the H-index.
//H-Index is the largest value such that the researcher has at least H papers that have been cited at least H times.



class Solution {
    // Function to find hIndex
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        // code here
        int n=citations.length;
        int [] arr=new int[n+1];
        
        for(int i:citations){
            if(i>n) arr[n]++;
            else arr[i]++;
        }
        
        int count=0;
        for(int i=n;i>=0;i--){
            count+=arr[i];
            if(count>=i) return i;
        }
        return 0;
